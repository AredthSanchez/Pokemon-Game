1. "CL3_Sanchez" is the main class used to simulate the Pokemon Game. This is where the user creates trainers, teams, and partners using basic I/O. The main class scans a file that has multiple pokemons to play with. 
2. The "Pokemon" class is used to assign and get the details of each pokemon (Pokemon name, type, Health and damage).
3. "Trainer" is the class used to assign Pokemons to a trainers team. It's also the class that allows the user to set a single pokemon as partner.
4. The "Region" class allows the user to create a region where the fights between Trainers and Pokemons take place. This class is also to add a wild pokemon to a created region from the scanned file.
5. Enjoy!
